I originally posted this on linkedin.
However, I think it is relevant to anyone in any technical role, or perhaps any role at all.

It’s ok not to know something yet.
Some SDK, or ecosystem of code, or particular system.
It’s not okay to confidently blag it.
Don’t ignore the question either, if you don’t know, say so.
If you’ve work to do to find out, say so.

A mature response to a question you don’t know, is along the lines of:
- I don’t know, let’s find out
- I don’t know, I might need to go and research that.
- I don’t know but X person does
- I don’t know, but here’s how you’d find out.

I get that the person who doesn’t know may have other responsibilities,
but then it’s even more important to say they don’t know and point you back in a direction to go find it.
Just don’t pretend to have an answer.

I confidently tell my kids when I can’t answer what they are asking,
and depending on what is on, I offer to find it with them because it could be fun and interesting.
I also confidently tell coworkers when I don’t know something,
and we can think about what we do next about that.
It’s not the end of the story, but a starting point for at least one of you.
You may also not be the first person they asked.

There will always be stuff about the world we don’t know.
Even down to small tech projects.
I’ve been doing Raspberry Pi and Python robotics for years.
And there is plenty I do not know.
It is probably on my todo list to learn, but I will not pretend to have all the answers,
just the kind of curious mind that would enjoy finding out!
And then sharing my findings.
