1. You will screw up. Screws ups are good learning - don't fear failure (Jeri Ellisworth). someone who screwed up has learned something. Celebrate failure.
2. Make sure you know when you screwed up ASAP.
3. Don't accept Dogma - use ideas from anywhere - some will work, some will be screw ups.
4. Use all reasonable means to preempt, catch, prevent or highlight screw ups for yourself. But don't be paralyzed by them.
