## About the book

In this book Danny shows how to build and program a robot using a Raspberry Pi, and the Python programming language. Also used are HTML, CSS and JS along with Linux tools.

These are used to make autonomous behaviours like Line following, wall avoiding, then visual processing leading to colored object tracking, face tracking, along with ways to manually drive it via a web app on a phone - combining camera views with WiFi. The robot is then linked with mycroft for a Voice Assistant so you can ask the robot to do things by talking!
